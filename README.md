# MNT Reform Kintex-7 SoM (MNT RKX7)

![MNT Reform Kintex-7 SoM (MNT RKX7) Render](images/mnt-rkx7-3d.png)

This is the open hardware system-on-module featuring the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA and 2GB DDR3 RAM. It can be used as an alternative to the main processor module in the [MNT Reform open hardware laptop](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform) or in any other custom device. The idea is to test synthesized open cores such as Ariane (RISC-V) or LibreSOC (OpenPOWER) in a real laptop. True emulation of vintage computer architectures in a laptop form factor is possible as well.

The module was designed by Lukas F. Hartmann (mntmn) of [MNT Research GmbH](https://mntre.com).

## Status

The initial design of the module is complete and we are now in the bringup phase. It is likely that there are further iterations necessary. Proceed with caution.

The design is made with [KiCAD, a free and open source EDA program](https://www.kicad.org/).
